# The Gloomwood "Comprehensive" Guide To Cheating

## Preface

This guide was created during the Fire at the Gates update!

## Currently Unknown Commands

These commands have no known use.
```
place
```

## Runtime Console Command List

The `help` command lists every command.

```
help
```

## Enabling Cheats

Enabling cheats allows you to use the `infinite` command.
```
cheats 1
```

## Lists

The `list` command lists all registered objects of certain types.
This can work with many types of objects, such as `props`, `weapons`,
`entities`, and more.

If we wanted to see a list of all `items` in the game, we could run this command:
```
list items
```
And it would output every item to the `Runtime Console`.

Here is every valid list command:
```
list ai
list corpse
list item
list weapon
list pickup
list prop
list readable
```

## Spawning AIs/Enemies

This is where it gets interesting.

Spawning entities is done with the `spawn` command.

For an example, let's spawn 20 fishdogs.

To spawn a fishdog, type and run this command:

```
spawn ai_fishdog
```

To spawn 20 fishdogs, type and run this command:

```
spawn ai_fishdog 20
```

All AIs/enemies are prefixed by `ai_`. This is mandatory.

## Spawning Items 

*Note: spawning items is different from giving yourself items.*

Spawning items is also done with the `spawn` command.

Let's spawn enough vitalizing tonics for the rest of your life.

```
spawn item_medhypo 50
```

All items are prefixed by `item_`. This is also mandatory.

## Infinite Resources

*Note: As of now, the infinite command only works with ammo.*

The `infinite` command allows you to give yourself an unlimited ammount
of any resource. This works by toggling on/off the selected resource type.

If we wanted to give ourselves infinite ammo, we would run this command:

```
infinite ammo 1
```

With this command, do note that `0` and `1` are equivalent to
`false` and `true` respectively.

## Giving yourself items and weapons
