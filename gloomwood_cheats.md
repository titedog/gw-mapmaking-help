## Spawning AIs/Enemies

This is where it gets interesting.

Spawning entities is done with the `spawn` command.

For an example, let's spawn 20 fishdogs.

To spawn a fishdog, type and run this command:

```
spawn ai_fishdog
```

To spawn 20 fishdogs, type and run this command:

```
spawn ai_fishdog 20
```

All AIs/enemies are prefixed by `ai_`. This is mandatory.

## Spawning Items 

*Note: spawning items is different from giving yourself items.*

Spawning items is also done with the `spawn` command.

Let's spawn enough vitalizing tonics for the rest of your life.

```
spawn item_medhypo 50
```

All items are prefixed by `item_`. This is also mandatory.

## Giving yourself items and weapons

*TODO*

## Miscellaneous cheats
